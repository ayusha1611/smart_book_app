The main problem that I faced during the development was making the updates in real-time while insertion and deletion. So I started solving this problem by using the help of documentation on how to enable the real-time updates. I learned about Supabase and its properties. I debug it by using the devtool and noting every message in the devtool and debugging it accordingly. After that, I got the desired result of real-time updates. After that Second problem I faced about deployment where it was giving me errors about the cookies in the middleware and vunerablities in the next.js version which I have solved using the help of AI tool by debugging the error and come with best solution. For this problem's Solution I added the redirect URI in the Google Authentication and also in the Supabase and and then updated into latest version of next.js. Then I find some small problems in the getting the idea of approach and functions which I solved using documentations and AI models. 

I deployed in the Vercel which link is: https://smartbookapp7.vercel.app

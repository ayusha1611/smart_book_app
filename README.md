The main problem that I faced during the development was making the updates in real-time while insertion and deletion. So I started solving this problem by using the help of documentation on how to enable the real-time updates. I learned about Supabase and its properties. I debug it by using the devtool and noting every message in the devtool and debugging it accordingly. After that, I got the desired result of real-time updates.
